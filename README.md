File 1) Bayesian-AND-OR-Operation.py

-> This project code is to read CSV files and prep the data for performing a Bayesian Inference using PyMC3 or 
Edward probabilistic programming. It performs an "AND" operation and "OR" operation from the CSV file. The 
functions are written to be extensible by adding additional conditions and maintainable.
Note: The code could be rewritten for MongoDB.
